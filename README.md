- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew, @smit3407
- 👀 I’m interested in code, baking bread, using the gym as a place to destress, and learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, C#, and always Java, JavaScript, and C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything atm. Hopefully more websites, a game, or other cool things.
- 📫 Reach me at smit3407@purdue.edu

I'm sure I will fill this in more later.

Github put this at the bottom of my README...
